# Coffee Shop Project With Mernis
Considering that we are working for Starbucks and Nero, it is a project that performs customer management for two companies. Both companies want to register their customers in the database. Starbucks always requires mernis verification when registering its customers. Nero does not ask for such verification when registering customers.
